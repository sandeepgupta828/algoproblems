Flexibility:
==========
Ability to add more patterns in future.

High Availability:
=================
Failover setup

Scalability:
============

(1) Concurrent games
--game played via api calls on stateless api servers
--any server can execute next step of game
--game state is stored in persistent scalable backend DB
--game state can be put in memcache (write through cache) for low latency

(2) Large number of players
Parallelization of processing tickets for marking next generated number
Not all tickets need to be load and processed by 1 server.

Fault tolerance:
================

--Save game state
  --against game id
--Api server's crashes
  --every game state mutation is first saved to DB so that we are protected by this occurrence.
